## Contents ##

- [Install NetBeans] (your work-environment for java programming).
- [Creating a new user] at GitHub (https://github.com).
- [Choose] whether you want to work just on the plugins for VRL-Studio or also change the code at VRL, VRL-Studio.
	- [fetch compiled version] of VRL from the web-page.
	- [clone repository] miho/VRL, miho/VRL-Studio from GitHub.
	- [fork repository].
- [Additional important functions] of GitHub.
- Install [Markdown] (to write your documentation).


## Install NetBeans  [Install NetBeans]
1. Download and instal Java (JDK) >=1.6, for example from: [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
2. Download and install a suitable version (>=7.01) of NetBeans, for example from: [http://netbeans.org/downloads/](http://netbeans.org/downloads/).

[Recommended literature for java-programming](http://openbook.galileocomputing.de/javainsel/).

For a better understanding of how GitHub works, look at the page: [http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html).


## Choose: 
### working just on the plugins (1. or 2.) 
###or also on VRL, VRL-Studio (3.)[Choose] 

##1.
If you want to work only on the plugins for VRL-Studio and you're not reliant on latest version, then:
### fetch compiled version of VRL from the web-page: [http://vrl-studio.mihosoft.eu](http://vrl-studio.mihosoft.eu) [fetch compiled version]

##2. 
If you want to work only on the plugins for VRL-Studio and you're reliant on latest version, then:
### clone repository from GitHub: [clone repository]

  -  Find repository of VRL-Project. Enter miho/VRL in search mask on the top left of the page:
	(see Figure [Repository of VRL-Project]); `Enter`.
  -  Copy from GitHub the link below "Git Read-Only" (for example: https://github.com/miho/VRL.git):

![Repository of VRL-Project][]

[Repository of VRL-Project]: resources/img/Repository-VRL-Project.png width=981px

  - Open NetBeans;
  - Go to the top menu Team -> Git -> Clone (to clone repository);

![NetBeans-Git-Clone][]

[NetBeans-Git-Clone]: resources/img/NetBeans-Git-Clone.png width=981px

  - Insert into your open window "Clone Repository"; also User und Password; click on `Next`;

![Clone-VRL-Repository][]

[Clone-VRL-Repository]: resources/img/Clone-VRL-Repository.png width=981px

  - Then choose "master"; then `Next`; then `Finish`.
  - Compile in NetBeans the Project VRL.
  - Repeat for VRL-Studio.

![Run VRL, VRL-Sudio][]

[Run VRL, VRL-Sudio]: resources/img/run-project.png width=981px

 Now you have everything to write the VRL-Plugins. [Next see here](first-plugin.html).

##3.
If you want to work also on the plugins as well as on VRL and VRL-Studio, then:
### fork repository from GitHub: [fork repository]
  - find repository of VRL-Project. Enter miho/VRL in search mask on the top left of the page;`Enter`;
  - fork repository of VRL-Project (click on the button "Fork" above right) and wait:
![fork repository][]

[fork repository]: resources/img/fork-miho-VRL.png width=980px

  - and then clone repository "your-name/VRL", "your-name/VRL-Studio" from GitHub, similar to this: [clone repository].

## Markdown  [Markdown] 
Markdown is a lightweight markup language, allowing people â€œto write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

You need it in order to write your documentation.

1. Install Markdown, for example from: [hhttp://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/download/](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/download/).

2. Install txt-Editor, for example TextMate, from: [http://textmate.softonic.de/mac](http://textmate.softonic.de/mac). 
	For Info: 
	Table with Styles for VRL-Projects you can find in your VRL -> Source Packages -> eu.mihosoft.vrl.rootplugin.content.help -> help.zip -> resources.css -> vrl-documentation.css
3.  Write your documentation in txt-Editor and save it "name.md"
	Call the Terminal, run the MarkDown, compile your file "name.md and produce new file "name.html".
	 
	 Example: `gcscuser06-iMac:~ user$ multimarkdown -o name.html -t html name.md`
